# **Security**

The 'security' folder houses essential components crucial for fortifying the security aspects of our application. This collection of modules is designed with the primary objective of minimizing security risks, addressing dependency compatibility concerns arising from deprecated or incompatible dependencies, and ensuring a clear separation of concerns within the application architecture.

## Benefits

### Minimization of Security Risks

The components in this folder are tailored to minimize potential security vulnerabilities, ensuring a robust defense against common threats.

### Dependency Compatibility

Addresses issues related to deprecated, discontinued, or incompatible dependencies, ensuring a smooth and secure application environment.

### Separation of Concerns

Encourages a modular and organized approach to security, promoting clearer separation of concerns for better maintainability.


## Key Components

### jwtSecretGenerator.js

<hr>

#### **Purpose:**
  1. This file generates a random secret key for JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.

#### **Functionality:**

  1. Utilizes the 'crypto-js' to create a secure, random 64-byte hexadecimal string.
  2. Logs the generated JWT secret to the console.

#### **Dependencies:**

  1. Requires the crypto-js package for cryptographic operations.

#### **Security Considerations:**

  1. Emphasizes the importance of safeguarding the generated JWT secret.
  2. Suggests using secure storage and management practices for sensitive information.

#### **Output**

  1. The generated JWT secret is logged to the console for development or debugging purposes.

#### **Usage Notes:**

  1. Intended for use in applications that require a secure, randomly generated JWT secret key.
  2. Care should be taken to manage and protect the secret key in production environments.

#### **Note**

  1. It is crucial to keep the generated JWT secret confidential, and exposing it may compromise the security of the application.

#### **Why is it here?:**

    1. **Discontinuation of Active Development:**
        - Active development of CryptoJS has been officially discontinued.

    2. **Lack of Maintenance:**
        - The library is no longer actively maintained, indicating a lack of ongoing updates and support.

    3. **Transition to Native Crypto Module:**
        - The latest version of CryptoJS has already adopted the native Crypto module for random number generation.
        - This is particularly important because using `Math.random()` for cryptographic purposes is not considered secure.
        - Further development of CryptoJS would essentially result in it becoming a wrapper for the native Crypto module.

    4. **Planned Adoption of Native Crypto:**
        - The recommendation is to transition to using the native Crypto module in Node.js and modern browsers for cryptographic operations.
        - This move ensures compatibility with contemporary security standards and reduces reliance on third-party libraries that are no longer actively developed.
        - We do intend to follow their recommendation and eventually transition to the native Crypto module, however, as with any migration, it is advisable to thoroughly test and validate the use of the native Crypto module in your specific context to ensure a seamless transition and maintain the security of cryptographic operations and only after that we shall migrate.
